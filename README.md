# wristcheck

_An application for managing your wrist watch collection._

WristCheck allows users to maintain a collection of watches, tracking key data about each watch as well as when they are being worn.

This data can then be aggregated and displayed in various charts and stats.

Users can also manage a wishlist of watches, as well as tracking details of previously sold watches.
