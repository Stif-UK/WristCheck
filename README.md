# wristcheck

_An application for managing your wrist watch collection._

WristCheck allows users to maintain a collection of watches, tracking when they are worn and their service dates.
Charts can be drawn to show the most worn watches, and filtered by month and year.

Users can also manage a wishlist of watches, as well as tracking details of previously sold watches.
